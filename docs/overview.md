With h00kd your networking is flawless!
By providing & securing a way to verify event attendance, h00kd grants you a unique digital scarcity, on-chain, forever.

## What is h00kd

H00kd is a platform that leverages NFT & POAP (Proof-of-attendance protocol) technology to enable issuers (e.g event creators) to create and distribute a digital artifact known as h00k.
A h00k is an NFT (Non-fungible token) minted on h00kd smart contract with a digital asset (image, video or audio) stored on IPFS network.

## h00kd flow

H00kd user flow is performed by two actors (Issuers and collectors):

- **Issuers**: Are event organizers and are responsible for:
  - Creating event's h00k: Providing all the details of the event for the creation of the h00k (check [guide](./user-guide/how-to-create-event))
  - Generating keys: Generating different types of keys depending on the distrbution method (check [How to generate claim keys](./user-guide/how-to-generate-keys-claim) & [How to generate account creation keys](./user-guide/how-to-generate-keys-create)).
  - Closing an event once the organizers decide to end the distribution process
- **Collectors**: Are event attendees and are granted the possibility to:
  - Claim h00ks using the QRCode or links provided for them by the issuers
  - View their h00ks on their gallery page
