## What is h00kd

h00kd is a platform that leverages NFT & POAP (Proof-of-attendance protocol) technology to enable issuers (e.g event creators) to create and distribute a digital artifact known as h00k.

A h00k is an NFT (Non-fungible token) minted on h00kd smart contract with a digital asset (image, video or audio) and stored on IPFS network.

## h00kd flow

H00kd user flow is performed by two actors (Issuers and collectors):

### Issuer
The issuer (e.g event organizer) is responsible for creating the event's h00k by providing all the details and then submitting the form to the contract deployed on NEAR chain.

After, the event is created the owner can generate private keys mapped with the event and then distribute them to the collectors either, to claim a h00k or to create a new NEAR account and claim.
When the event is done, the issuer can close it and get back the amount of the hooks not claimed.
